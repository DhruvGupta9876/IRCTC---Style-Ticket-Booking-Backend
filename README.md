User registration and management

View available trains

Book train tickets

Generate ticket details

Modular service-based architecture

Simple and beginner-friendly Java code

🛠️ Technologies Used

Java (JDK 8+)

OOP Principles

Console-based UI

git clone https://github.com/your-username/IRCTC-Train-Booking-System.git


Navigate to the project directory:

cd IRCTC-Train-Booking-System


Compile the Java files:

javac *.java


Run the application:

java IRCTCAPP

The application starts from IRCTCAPP.java

Users can be created using UserService

Train details are stored using the Train class

Ticket booking logic is handled by Bookingservice

Ticket details are generated using the Ticket class

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Understanding Java OOP design

Separation of concerns using service classes

Real-world application simulation

Improved logical and problem-solving skills

🚀 Future Enhancements
